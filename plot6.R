# Question: 6
# Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, 
# California (fips == "06037"). 
# Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
